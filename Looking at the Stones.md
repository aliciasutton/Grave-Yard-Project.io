The grave yard project was a very interesting project to me because it introduced basic field work. This was with the idea of viewing, recording and analysing. 


The site I chose to look at it contained two grave stones with 5 burials. This belonged to a family by the name of Curry in section AJ in the South Gower Cemetery in Kemptville, Ontario. One stone had 1 burial and the other had 4 burials. The site had a curb surrounding it that had deteriorated to some extent with time and the heaving of Canadian frost.

On the stone with the 4  people I believe it is the father and mother and a son. The one person Mary however is hard to determine the relationship as she is younger then the parents but quite older then the brothers.

On the single stone I believe it is a second brother. 


I also tried to find stylistically similar stones to try and determine if the stone was erected around of the time of the first deceased family member or for the last family member. 

To me it appeared to be around the first man that died based on the elements on the stone and the time they appear on other stones in the cemetery. For example the shape of the stone, the cups on top and the ivy leave details.



These stones all show the similar ivy detail.

These two stones have the circular pillar shape of the main stone.

These last two stones were quite similar in that they share the stones colour as well as the cup detail at the top.

I also found other stones with the name Curry near these stones but I am unsure of the relationship between the groups of people.The Main man was born the same year as Mary.
